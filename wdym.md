- Just read through First Drops, you might have an idea about what's going on here.
- There is no particular genre I am trying to fulfill here. All kinds of stuff will be tried out.
- Since this is a blog, of all sites.
- Blog hosted on Github Pages and runs on Jekyll, which generates static sites from Markdown language.
- Based on a tweaked template of Jekyll called [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by Barry Clark.
