It's the year 2008. After a costly jab at GPRS internet via BSNL, my Dad switched to Hutch. One of the popular brands at that time, thanks to the pug. That was my first taste at Hutch. It didn't last long. Within a year, Hutch was acquired by Vodafone UK, renaming itself to Vodafone India. Vodafone had employed an even better ad strategy - via expressive doll beings speaking gibberish, commonly known as Zoozoos. Some might argue that Airtel's ads were better. However, this article is not about ads.

It wasn't until 2012 that I started to appreciate the coverage and the speed of the network. While it was well known that they offered plans which were costlier compared to competitor's offerings, it was also true that the overall network coverage was better when it came to Vodafone. 

At least, that's the conclusion I came to after my dad wasted money on Airtel for a 2G USB modem connection. Maybe it could have been the location of my home at that time, but Airtel offered incredibly poor speeds on 2G. We are talking about 10 to 20 KB/sec! I remember taking my dad's bulky laptop he had bought for work to the rooftop (your usual home in a village with one floor) to check whether I could get some more lines on the Tower icon. Nope, it was awful. One fine day in 2012, I decided to swap the Vodafone sim card from the Chinese mobile my dad bought for home communication onto the 2G USB modem. As a precaution, I recharged it with a mini data pack.

It didn't work. I googled and googled, until I found in an article that those are locked to a particular network - in my case, Airtel. And there was an easy way to unlock it. All I had to do, was to download and run an "OEM unlocker" and install an original device firmware for the modem. It was made by Huawei, and Airtel seemed to have slapped their logo and colors on the shell and rebranded it as their own. After carefully considering the complications, I took an unsure step forward and installed the unlocker, followed the instructions and installed the Huawei firmware. To my surprise, it worked!

Finally, it was time to test the download speeds. During that period, the limited data pack community had a habit of using "download managers". These software programs allow you to split the download in pieces - similar to torrents, allowing simultaneous downloading to maximize the usage of network bandwidth. I began to download the most necessary software in the world - a web browser. Looking at the speeds, I was awestruck.

The browser was being downloaded at speeds in excess of 100 KB/sec. Imagine switching from 4G to 5G for the first time (currently, Vi users can only imagine). It was that much of an impact, except that I was still using 2G. From that moment, I have stayed clear from Airtel, even to this day.
