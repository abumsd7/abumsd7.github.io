The new generation of youngsters (including me) are super passionate. Not just about their career or ambitions, but also about spending time doing nothing but staring at the screen. Some take up multiple jobs, some dedicate time in polishing their skills, some learn entirely new skills and some stare at the screen for long as we can, binge-watching some interesting show or playing an addictive game. However, there is one impossible hurdle for everyone to cross. The time, which is necessary for carrying out the activities, is bound to just 24 hours a day. I am sure every one of you must be thinking about doing that one extra thing you wanted before the clock strikes 12am. In this article, we will be looking at various ways to live more than 24 hours a day.

## Altering timekeeping devices.

Easiest trick in the book, is to manipulate the time that being shown to you. We might have to do some preparations ahead. By time manipulation, I refer to the art of altering timekeeping devices. These include predominantly wall clocks, followed by alarm clocks, wristwatches and mobile phones. 

A wall clock is a traditionally used timekeeper, usually fitted on walls and are battery-powered. While a majority of human population still uses analog clocks, I have seen the rare 7 segment LCD clocks which not only display time, but also dates, temperature and few other useless stuff. It's strictly advised to avoid digital clocks like them for this experiment.

Generally, we adjust time on these analog clocks by rotating a gear on the back of the clock. For time manipulation on a closed space, these clocks are your best friend. You need to acquire a used battery, preferably Eveready or Duracell. Used batteries have less electricity, and are a perfect option in this context. Simply fit one of those used batteries onto the back of the analog clock, fit it in the wall, and forget it. The minimal electricity in the battery ensures that the dials rotate slower than usual. Sometimes, they might even stop, and rotate again. Using this simple trick is proven to improve the number of hours on a day in a drastic manner. When the clock seems to stop altogether, all you need to do is to unmount it off the wall and give a nice slap on the back, and it is good to go!

We can also use the same trick on alarm clocks (remember, only the analog ones) to achieve maximum efficiency. With the slowed down time, the alarm you had set will ring a bit later than usual, which is a positive indication that our day has actually extended beyond 24 hours!

Coming to wristwatches, a kind recommendation is to avoid using them. Screwed shut batteries make it harder for you to manipulate them without twisting the gear in the analog ones. A common method we can use here, is to twist the gear anti-clockwise a little/hour. Ignore 9-segment LCD watches though, their time manipulation techniques take a bit more effort to actually do something substantial, that you might waste the precious time you just gained. 

Modern smartwatches refer your mobile phone for time, so they are a useless device when it comes to solitary manipulation. In conjunction with a smartphone, however, they serve as a powerful tool to meddle with your perception of time.

Current tech society owns more mobile phones than watches, in a sense that they are used more than watches to view time. Heck, some have entirely abandoned the use of watches in favor of smartphones. In a smartphone, one can either manually set time, or rely on time-syncing servers to maintain time without any error. For our cause, we should strictly abandon the thought of syncing the device time with the server. It is recommended to follow the inaccurate wall clock and set an arbitrary time, whatever that appears clearly to you. Set the timezone to your location, and then forget about the time and date settings. Don't visit there again. Don't sync time. The effects won't be immediate. Give it some time, some weeks, some months, and you can see that the time will start to vary between the synced one and the non-synced one. It will be mere minutes, but as months go on, they will increase minute by minute. 

While it might seem that all those additions are actually speeding up the sense of time, you need to understand that timekeeping using your smartphone's battery might not be that accurate as a cesium atomic clock installed in space. They might gain or lose seconds on a daily basis. This clearly implies the possibility that the local time can increase or decrease in the count of minutes over a long period. That's right. Your device's time will have already entered the unpredictable territory by then. From this, we can conclude that smartphones have the ability to distort your sense of time more than any other device due to their dependence of battery power. Let's move onto another method which helps flesh out the simulation further.

## Setup indoor illumination

While time manipulation does let you lose track of time, it doesn't help much if you are witnessing the natural day-night cycle. As a creature belonging to the human race who has lived for generations in this world, having studied how days and nights work and adapted themselves to it, we have something called a biological clock that helps us rest when it's dark and keep us active when it's bright.

But for someone who is striving to gain access to additional time in a day, this is disastrous news. When you think you have cracked the time-saving formula by manipulation of timekeeping devices, the organic, biological clock will do its job and put you into extreme tiredness and subsequently sleep by the end of the day. 

Then comes the question about the biological clock. Since it's still a clock, could we not just manipulate it too?

The answer is yes. And it's a well-known answer too. Every one of us must have tried to stay beyond our usual sleep time and see if we could stay awake. Many have failed. Many have succeeded in the initial stage, before eventually dozing off. Very little manage to actually beat their usual sleep time and stay awake till they please. There are also few who suffer from insomnia, and don't have the luxury to attempt such challenges. Their body ignores day-night cycles, so naturally they spend more than 24 hours a day. It would be an understatement to say that they might not even have such hour limits to complete days. Do they even have to count days though? Insomniacs, please clarify. We can better ignore them for this tutorial.

Now, how can we effectively manipulate the biological clock into thinking that we are not staying awake past our usual bedtime?

One of the key factors which make us think about the days and nights, is the sky. The rotation of Earth, which changes the position of the two light sources in the sky
