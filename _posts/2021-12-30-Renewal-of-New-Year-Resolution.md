title: Renewal of New Year Resolution(?)

It was 2 days ago when I received reminder from the free domain provider I had registered for my blog last year. 

Then I remembered what I had intended to do during that time of the year - the end of 2020. 

It was a crazy year for many people including the college student me, who was doing the final year of my degree. 
On that fateful day of 30th December this strange idea rose to the top of my list of interests. 

Establishing a blog on GitHub was an interesting activity and in addition to that I thought of writing regularly and publishing articles on that everyday similar to a diary of sorts.
Except that it's open to the public.

But it differs from a diary in the sense that I was recording totally random and irrelevant things. One week later I had to go deep into preparation for my semester examinations.
At that point of time I lost interest to write for this blog. It just so happens that my of interest is pretty short unless I work on that activity continuously and the exams had virtually put a full stop to that.

Surprisingly, the superior power that always cares about you - which is Google, reminded me to renew the domain which I got for free almost one year ago. Along with that it also kinda renewed my long forgotten new year resolution of writing random articles. 

I can only hope no other hurdle stands in my way this time.
