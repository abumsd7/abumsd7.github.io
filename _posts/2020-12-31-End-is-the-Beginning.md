Something to welcome the new year.  

2020 started in a different flavour for Cricket fans. The year numbers were aligning with the exciting shorter
format of the game, filled with dominating one side shows, dramatic comebacks, final over snatches and even
exhilirating super-overs. What was not expected was the game dragging into cancellation - not by rain, not by
light failures, not by team troubles. But by something which was unpredictable just like the game itself.

While all these calamities were ravaging us in this month, and this
year on a whole,  one thought was nagging my mind. To vent out
the constant thought process we have been put into ever since this unbreakable Eastern Lock was forged on March
to seal the borders.  

A lock so strong that even smugglers feared to break it open and do their business.  

The reason? Quite simple. The lock was invisible, atleast to the naked eye. For once, escape artists and safebreakers had
faced a task that was far out of their tricks and lockpicks. And hence the way to break through it has become impossible. Not yet.
Assurances are made, tests are conducted and mass production is on the way. But the world, as it stands currently,
still requires massive financial compensations to come out of the high interest loan which it acquired 9 months ago.
Lives are at stake, yet the ingredients to concoct the elixir of life are being kept as a secret to monetize it. To
resolve the debt of the wizard who came up with it after perfecting it through research.  

After the virtual shackles were "virtually" broken, every one of us began to wander in their our manner.
When everyone were eagerly waiting for the credits to roll, what followed was a frustrating post-credit sequence
which has no leads on how the sequel would pan out. People who missed out on it, were ultimately the cause of it.
The unbreakable lock was rearranging itself. It has life, afterall. It has gained it's wisdom. 

17 years from midnight still remain for us to face the Year Date bug. With the unpredictability factor lurking around, many *memesters* are already planning for it to happen on the stroke of midnight. While the casual side of the town were focusing on enjoying the climax of the disaster of a movie that haunted us, many life reviewers are already expecting the sequel to release at 12 am tomorrow morning. Will the key of immunity be distributed to everyone soon?

Wishing that atleast the next year could be more profitable to the average human among our everyday crowd.  

The post-credit sequence isn't over yet.
