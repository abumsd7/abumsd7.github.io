I opened my eyes. An unknown ceiling awaited me. The scene was straight outta some popular TV show. Guess the high-effort binge watches were finally taking its toll. But on a serious note, this scenery didn't vanish when I rubbed my eyes. The reality of the situation washed over me. Cold sweat started to pour down, cleansing the reality - no that's not it. In fact, it soaked the reality so hard that the bedsheet was a sweaty mess.

<!--more-->
Was the bedsheet even part of the reality, or it's a dream... Nothing was certain until I ascertained where I was. I looked over the ceiling again. The ever trusty, crusty and dusty fan was missing. No wonder I didn't cough upon waking. I looked around the room and saw an air conditioner. For a fleeting moment, the thought of an air conditioner being inferior to the fan crossed my mind. I took the cardboard laying on the cupboard shelves and blowed away the infuriating thought. I then looked around for the AC remote - unironically powered by batteries. The temperature showed 20 degrees Celsius. 

What?? Is the air conditioner broken? Is the remote broken? No, it seems to work just fine. Then the problem must be within the air conditioner. As a guy with just one piece of experience operating air conditioners, my knowledge was as minimal as tweaking the temperature levels. For an average Indian roasted under the summer sun, 20 degrees is the equivalent to a cold bottle of water. Some do prefer to take it with extra ice, some prefer directly eating the ice (in flavours). The temperature levels drop to the lower levels in such cases.

An air conditioner, operating at 20 degrees, throughout the night, should have clearly chilled the room enough for my cold sweat to subside. Maybe I should ramp up the temperature to melt the cold sweat down...

I noticed the windows of my room. They were closed. But I have barely closed the window since the start of April, citing the heat. Contrary to the expectations of the weather, they were frosted, and their transparency was severely affected. Heh… the AC did do its part. I released the lock on the sliding window and pushed it towards the right side. What I saw next truly blew my mind.

….

Rebuilding mind… 23%...44%...78%...97%...

Huh, strange. I do remember about the window, but what happened after it? Is there some sort of a trigger word? Hmm, I should be careful. I reached out to my usual spot – where I keep my toothbrush and the toothpaste, but they were long gone. Years of overuse had finally pushed them to the breaking point. Currently they are attending counselling sessions with the 1/10 doctor. The doctor is a good man, but the corporates hated him for saying the one thing they hated most – honest, unfiltered truth. I once asked him, “What is the reason you never recommend my favourite toothpaste?” He said a simple but wise statement. “Without disagreements, quality never improves.”

Before leaving the hospital though, I replied him back. “You are worthy to be a project manager – except that you might disagree with not only the developer but the client as well.” Then I never heard from him again. One of the mouthwash liquids I had told me that the doctor added me to the “not recommended by experts” list. By that it means that I won’t be getting any review units. Not that I was getting it previously.

I picked the review unit lying around in my bag (it was a gift from that doctor, no reason to suspect me) and unpacked it. Two brand new brush and paste was inside. I took them out gleefully, and then applied some paste to the brush part. Except that there was no paste! Then I had a hard look at the bristles of the brush. A cinematic zoom-in showed that they were not bristles, but actually very tiny tubes, through which the toothpaste comes out. The entire length of toothbrush’s handle was a storage reserve of sorts. Both the toothpaste tube and toothbrush had to be docked airtight for the paste to be refilled in the toothbrush reserve. It’s certainly an interesting piece of tech, but this shouldn’t have surprised me. Why do the words from my fingertips, typed on the Word application, appear alien to my inner self-consciousness? The answer should lie within the discrepancies with my memory and the text.

I should find the root cause of this, otherwise….
