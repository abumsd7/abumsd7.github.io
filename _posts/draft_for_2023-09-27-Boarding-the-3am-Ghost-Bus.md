The extravagant luxury bus came to a halt. The passengers stepped out, one by one, with reddened eyes and sleepy faces. One could mistake the crowd for a zombie army. However, in the middle of the crowd, there appeared a shiny gem - truly the golden trash among other trash. He was known as Hito, a truly self explanatory name. His eyes shone like a newly cleaned window glass exposed to running water. He didn't rush to exit the bus, and waited for his turn to leave. His co passengers looked at him with questionable expressions. But he was unwavered. People liked seeing fellow humans who stand in the face of adversity. It was later understood that he was in the middle of washing his face with the bottled water so that he could give a thunderous entry while getting off the bus with flying dust and sparks.

After seeing the flock of taxi drivers swarming the bus stop area, Hito decided to silently stuff the sawdust and firecrackers in his hand into his travel bag. He then proceeded to give one of the boring entries in the history of metropolitan entries. A simple walk onto the metallic steps attached below the passenger entrance.

The grand metropolitan city of In-Nache. A city where reality becomes fiction. Many aspired individuals come to this city while facing the reality of the crossroads of their life. For those who couldn't take their last step into facing reality, In-Nache provided them with various chances to etch the legend they wanted into the fantasized world of fiction - a world where your identity never fades and your humanity becomes a literal word.

A dream come true - for someone like Hito, who was never able to take the steps into reality. He decided to choose the path of fiction after careful deliberation. He decided to pause his inner monologue so that he won't be revealing much about the city earlier into the story.

Now, all he had to do was reach the residential area, from where he could stay and plot his plan of world domination. The first step, ofcourse, is to find a source of income for survival. While sitting clueless on the bus for 8 hours, he was listening to an interesting story. One of the passengers in the seat before his, was narrating the tale of how he earned thousands via simple transmission of information. It was not the postman job though. An informant - a confidential and careful job which requires good knowledge about the world around them and how to operate in secret without alerting the middlemen. Hito felt that he was a bit over qualified for the job. 

He was reminded by his memory - about his meticulous plans to execute the Great Revolution, crafted via the impeccable observational knowledge of his. During his days of exile at his home, he painstakingly observed the buses that come and go at the nearest bus stop at his hometown via the average sized windows.
