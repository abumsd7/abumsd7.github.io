Sorry for being so late about this!  
<!--more--> 
But it's better late than never!

Let's skip the niceties - you must have scanned an invite and may have already known. If not, here's the digital invite. It's simple and conveys the necessary information.

It happens on Thursday, a weekday. 

As an IT professional myself, I know how hard it is to get leaves on weekdays.

Even I had to skip some weddings due to this problem. I feel really sorry about it.

Thus, I understand if you are facing a similar situation. 

I will not put my utmost expectations on your arrival.

If you do arrive, I will not be expecting it either... so you can relax and make your decision.üòÅ

I will keep updating this article when there are any new updates. Message me if you have any queries.

[Some people asked me this, so I'm adding it. Click me to go to Official Govt. of Tamilnadu Website on Perambalur, incase you are looking for places to visit other than the marriage venue.üòí](https://perambalur.nic.in/)

If you have chosen to travel the distance, here are some tips...

## Bus riders:
 - Honestly, this is the easiest way to reach Perambalur.
 - Chennai Kilambakkam to Perambalur New Bus Stand : 239km
 - Perambalur New Bus Stand to Old Bus Stand: 2.7km
 - Perambalur Old Bus Stand to Anbu Mahal (wedding venue): 1.1km
 - Below is the snapshot of TNSTC webpage, taken on August 8, 11pm.

## Train riders:
 - All trains from Chennai to Ariyalur are on waitlist at the time of writing this article : once again I apologize for this delay in communication.
 - Tatkal is an option, but success rate is low.
 - Train ride spans across Chennai Tambaram and Ariyalur.
 - From Ariyalur, you might have to take a bus to Perambalur and repeat last 2 points of previous section.
 - If you are going for Tatkal, then below trains should be viable for arrival on 3rd September.
 - Vaigai SF Express : arrives at 5.30pm to Ariyalur.
 - Pallavan SF Express: arrives at 7.45pm to Ariyalur.
 - I will not recommend Early morning trains and late night trains : connectivity between the Railway station and bus stand might be severly limited during this period.
