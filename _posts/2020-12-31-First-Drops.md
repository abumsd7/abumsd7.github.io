It has started to spill. Or has it been forced to?

Picturing something on *your mind* before it's been made is a forgettable thing to do.  

And I mean it in a literal sense. How many morning dreams and classroom imaginations we would
have experienced in our life, only to forget it the moment our mind starts to wander into reality?  

It's uncountable. Merely because we tend to forget that we even dreamed or imagined it at first place. Yet, at a fortunate minute of your daily routine, when the mind tries to escape the grasps
of the boredom (if you had one), one insignificant drop from our sealed subconscious spills out.  

A very small and unnoticeable drop, holding a fragment of whatever you imagined while your thinking mind was unaware, will seep through the thick fiber - that is your daily responsibilties, enveloping
your cerebrum - the thinking part of your brain.  

At that moment, your actions will diverge in two ways.  

- The old detective, who has been used to the recurring pattern of the cases he attends to, and deals with the new one in a nonchalant manner.

- The new detective, who is eager to grasp on whatever clues that has been thrown to him. He also has
an understanding about the clues, but he lets his imagination run wild.  

(I have no clue on how detectives operate in real life. The points mentioned above are a vague representation of whatever I consumed through visual media)

One thing not to take an inspiration from the above points is that imagination is strictly **not**
limited to youngsters. Many writers and artists have shown that imagination can work in conjunction with
experience and wisdom to create even more realistic representation of their imaginations.
Your state of mind contributes greatly in allowing you to picture the characters. If reality is eating out your emotions, 
your wacky ideas can't stay safe inside your mind palace.  

Which brings us to the part where I had mentioned about the fragment from your subconscious. Where it will stay safe for
you to recollect it later?  

Time to construct your mind palace. You are going to picture a blueprint of whatever that makes you comfortable and renowned engineer 
Mr.Neo Cortez will build it for you! Not everyone can afford to live a luxurious lifestyle. But our reality is not bound to what
our mind desires. The key witness of your unrealized secret, Mr.Fragimagent arrives as a guest to your mind palace. 
But there is no time to give him tea and sweets! It is the same reason, that you are preparing for an apocalypse! 
A destruction of massive scale is impending! By whom, you might ask. The destroyer of dreams, the ambusher of abstract thoughts, none
other than Emperor Rheal Zason.  

But it's your lucky life! You have two aces up your two sleeves. Mr.Sinister on your left and Mr.Dexter on your right. You have the
control over them. They will respond to whatever absurd action that you think and the sweet part? They can do it outside your mind
palace! With a newfound vigour not to lose the key evidence from Mr.Fragimagent, you send the instructions to them through 
the nerve-optic network - one of the fastest wired broadband service providers. Through the secure transmission, they reach out your
favourite right-hand man Mr.Dexter. He spends close to an hour recording them by typing them out on the keyboard with the 
occasional help of Mr.Sinister.  

As the clues are recorded, you then begin to obtain a detailed image of what Mr.Fragimagent was trying to imply.  

> You have been manipulated by me, Emperor Rheal all along!

A strange voice echoed inside your mind.  

You are dumbfounded! You then try to calm down and try to view the clues in a different manner. Then you start to notice
the reasons why the voice had called you out.

> All of these clues, were nothing but clues which lead to the bigger picture built through my resources and
the planning of Ms.Imagy Nathan. The engineer you cherished, Mr. Neo Cortez was the chief architect of this! But he has
a condition. He won't remember anything about what he builds. He does the job he's been assigned to, and he does it well.  

Your aces on the keyboard alert you with distress signals.  

But it doesn't matter for you. 'Cause the case has been solved. The purpose of the mind palace has been
fulfilled. You send the confirmation signals to Mr.Sinister and Mr.Dexter and prepare for annihilation by Emperor Rheal,
with the case details safely preserved as text so that you can reminiscence about it later.  

Until then.
