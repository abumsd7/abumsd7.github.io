Started 2020 with the possibility  
of achieving many positive things  
Alas... what followed was a test of feasibility  
To break people for whom it greatly stings.  
<!--more-->
Oblivious to the cries of our neighbour  
We stayed our own way, chose to remain in the dark  
Went down the drain, hardship and labour  
Now we wonder, will our economy make it's mark?  

In the season when rain is a rarity  
When we ditched Gigs of bandwidth to waste  
There came the Cloud Services, like a calamity  
Trapping us on the Net, draining the data with haste.  

For one or two weeks, social media would keep  
Viral media content's reach, at it's peak  
When it's time for the Chart Topper to bow down  
There came it's sibling, infusing us with the face of a clown!
